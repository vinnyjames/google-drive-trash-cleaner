# Google Drive Trash Cleaner

## Dependencies
To use the Python script directly
* Python 3.5+
* Required packages: *google-api-python-client*, *google-auth*, *google-auth-oauthlib*, and *google-auth-httplib2*. Run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
to install all dependencies

## How-to
Download `cleaner.py`, place it in an empty local folder, and run it from command line.

By default, `cleaner` retrieves a list of all files trashed more than 30 days ago, and prints their info on screen.
You're asked whether you want to delete them.
If confirmed, these files are permanently deleted from Google Drive.

### Google authorization
Before running `cleaner` for the first time, you need to set up OAuth 2.0 credentials:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project and enable the Google Drive API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app type)
4. Download the JSON file and save it as `client_secrets.json` in the same directory as `cleaner.py`

The first time you run `cleaner`, you will be prompted with a Google authorization page asking you for permission to view and manage your Google Drive files.
Once authorized, a credential file will be saved in `.credentials/google-drive-trash-cleaner.json` under your home directory.
You don't need to manually authorize `cleaner` again until you delete this credential file or revoke permission on your Google [account](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions "Apps connected to your account") page.
You can specify a custom location for the credential file by using the command line option `--credfile`. This is helpful if you're using multiple Google accounts with `cleaner`.

### `page_token` file
`cleaner` finds out when your files were trashed by scanning through your Google Drive activity history.
On first run, it must start from the very beginning to ensure no files are missed, so it might take some time.
After first run, `cleaner` saves a file named `page_token` in its own parent folder.
This file contains a single number indicating an appropriate starting position in your Google Drive activity history for future scans,
so they can be much faster than the first one. Each run of `cleaner` updates `page_token` as appropriate.  
You can specify a custom location or name for the `page_token` file by using the command line option `--ptokenfile`.

### More options
More command line options are available. You can read about them by running `cleaner --help`.
```
usage: cleaner [-h] [-a] [-v] [-d #] [-q] [-t SECS] [-m] [--noprogress]
               [--fullpath] [--logfile PATH] [--ptokenfile PATH]
               [--credfile PATH] [-g [PATH]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --auto            Automatically delete older trashed files in Google
                        Drive without prompting user for confirmation
  -v, --view            Only view which files are to be deleted without
                        deleting them
  -d #, --days #        Number of days files can remain in Google Drive trash
                        before being deleted. Default is 30
  -q, --quiet           Quiet mode. Only show file count.
  -t SECS, --timeout SECS
                        Specify timeout period in seconds. Default is 300
  -m, --mydriveonly     Only delete files in the 'My Drive' hierarchy,
                        excluding those in 'Computers' etc.
  --noprogress          Don't show scanning progress. Useful when directing
                        output to files.
  --fullpath            Show full path to files. May be slow for a large
                        number of files. NOTE: the path shown is the 'current'
                        path, may be different from the original path (when
                        trashing) if the original parent folder has moved.
  --logfile PATH        Path to log file. Default is no logs
  --ptokenfile PATH     Path to page token file. Default is "page_token" in
                        cleaner's parent folder
  --credfile PATH       Path to OAuth2Credentials file. Default is
                        ~/.credentials/google-drive-trash-cleaner.json
  -g [PATH], --globs [PATH]
                        Use glob patterns from config file for pattern-based
                        deletion. Default file: globs.json. When specified,
                        ignores --days.
```

### Glob-based deletion

The `-g/--globs` option enables pattern-based deletion using a JSON config file. Example `globs.json`:

```json
{
    "maxFilesPerDelete": 100,
    "maxDateOpened": "2025-01-01",
    "requiredParent": "myFolder",
    "globs": [
        "*.json",
        "backup_*.txt"
    ]
}
```

Config options:
- `globs` (required): Array of glob patterns to match filenames
- `maxFilesPerDelete`: Maximum files to process per confirmation prompt (default: 100)
- `maxDateOpened`: Only delete files last opened before this date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `requiredParent` (optional): Only delete files that have this folder name somewhere in their path ancestry
